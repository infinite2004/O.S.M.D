# O.S.M.D (Optical-Scanning-Mathematic-Service)
 
 Created a device that can scan and solve mathematical problems using a Pi Camera and Math-Pix API to process and identify the math being scanned

 The circuit would use a Raspberry Pi, Pi Camera, Jumper wires, and LCD screen.  The code for the device is written entirely in Python it uses libraries such as OpenCV, JSON, and RPIO.GPIO
